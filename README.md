Lesson 15

Project II
Create an application which allows to do the puzzle:

Windows' specification
First window: Main menu which allows to start the game.

Game window: divide the window using criss cross (m√ón). One rectangle needs to be empty, the rest is filled with parts of an image. User can change the location of a puzzle by switching it with the empty spot (one can do this by pressing buttons or using mouse etc.). The window contains a timer which counts a time from the start until the puzzle is solved. Important: to receive the highest grade, the program has to cut the base image into smaller parts.

Window with information about the previous games (time included) (needs to be saved to a file).

Grading
Project grade consists of:

Compilation (no compilation means 0 points)
Clean code
Responsive application
Quality of used mechanisms for working with a file
Solving a problem of multi-threading
Answering questions while defending a project
Ability to modify a code while defending a project
Punctuality with submitting the project
Using JavaFx

Different project
Student can change the project but it has to be approved by a teacher.

New project has to have the similar level of difficulty as the project described above. It should use the similar amount of JavaFx.
